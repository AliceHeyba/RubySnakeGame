Besides Tetris Snake was Nokia's most addictive game! I made a game using Ruby2 D - enjoy this blast from the past

Use your keyboards arrows to move up/down/righ/left and catch as many squares as you can without having the snake crash into itself.
If you crash the game is over and you can restart by pressing Key 1.

Good luck!
